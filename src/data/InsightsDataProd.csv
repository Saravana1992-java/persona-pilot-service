1719689873,The Metrics Factory: Machine-Generated SQL To Produce ADAS Metrics,"ADAS data scientists support the development and analysis of feature use metrics by authoring SQL queries against production data sets (not to mention cranking out the production data itself). For example, support for one particular dashboard requires monthly and monthly-cumulative BlueCruise use overall, use by model, and use by country of vehicle sale. Query requests can be situational, may involve new dimensions (""do we have any data about BlueCruise successful FTT by residential zip code?""), and requirements often change (""I meant by zip code and model""). Queries can have multiple variants.
Maintaining a human-generated SQL code base to do this at scale is a growing challenge. Would migrating to a framework of machine-generated SQL not only solve the current issues but move us in the direction of self-service custom data access and, more ambitiously, data delivery from natural language requests to an LLM?
Spoiler alert: I think so.
Inspired by classic Unix command-line utilities and pipes, and J.

1719556683,Connected Vehicle Feature Store,"Connected vehicle Feature Data Store is a centralized repository used to store, manage, and serve machine learning (ML) features. Features are individual measurable properties or characteristics used as input for ML models. A feature store ensures that these features are consistent, reusable, and available for both training and serving ML models.

Benefits of a Feature Data Store
1. Consistency: Ensures that the same feature computation logic is used during both training and serving, reducing discrepancies.
2. Reusability: Allows features to be reused across different models and projects, saving time and resources.
3. Versioning: Maintains different versions of features, enabling tracking and rollback if needed.
4. Real-time and Batch Processing: Supports both real-time feature serving and batch feature processing.
5. Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration by providing a centralized place for data scientists and engineers to share and access features.

We have currently leveraged the Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform that offers a managed feature store that integrates seamlessly with other Google Cloud services.

Tesla Supercharger access is important for Ford, because it will greatly increase the public fast chargers that Ford BEV owners can use. One important piece of this access to the Tesla Supercharger network is installation of a Certificate which will allow for integration.

Ford is rolling out the Certificate to Ford BEV vehicles in the US and Canada gradually and need to track the percentage of vehicles that install the Certificate successfully after it is sent, both within 24 hours and overall. In addition, for vehicles that do not install the Certificate in a timely manner, the number of retries needs to be monitored closely.",false,,"Almost all the installations are within 24 hours, but there are 2-3% that are getting picked up after that initial 24 hours., BEV vehicle Certificate installation success is hovering around 78.7%, which indicates we need to do more to push these certificates to our vehicles.

1707493407,Feasibility of LLMs in document/form completion for the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) ,The Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a federally required documentation process surrounding the development of any new vehicle features that touch vehicle telemetry. Given the federal requirements around this process it is necessary that Ford maintains and encourages compliance; however there exists a gap between engineering teams and their knowledge of data privacy and privacy regulations that has made completion of the PIA a slow process. Here we explore Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with an LLM to understand if it can assist in completion of the PIA process. We considered multiple models that vary in the level of document quality in the RAG scenario.

1706903182,Utilizing BERTopic in LLM Pipeline Leads to Superior Completions,"In response to the need for improved comprehension of customer feedback, we recently implemented automated topic modeling techniques using BERTopic to analyze customer concerns. However, it became evident that this approach lacked the necessary customer context to fully understand pain points and provide proactive solutions. To address this gap, we developed a large language model (LLM) to provide contextual summaries for customer feedback, enhancing the topic modeling efforts. The LLM allows users to engage in question-answer sessions about customer feedback, with the option to incorporate BERTopic in the pipeline for evaluating opinion shifts. Leveraging LangChain’s framework and Google's Vertex AI suite, specifically the PaLM2 model, our LLM aims to assess changes in customer opinions following the release of the Mozilla research on automotive data privacy and utilize fine-tuning techniques to enhance the quality of LLM summaries. Our research provides insights into the potential of LLMs in understanding and responding to customer feedback, particularly in the context of data privacy concerns.

",false,2024-01-26,"Key results include the significant enhancement of LLM data retrieval and completions through the utilization of BERT-generated topics for prompts, as well as the revelation of heightened awareness of data privacy issues in social media following the release of Mozilla’s research, resulting in a notable decrease in public trust in automotive data privacy and an increase in consent withdrawal rates. We emphasize the importance of rigorously evaluating LLM performance using accuracy metrics such as ROUGE, GLUE, and SuperGLUE, and recommend the incorporation of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to further enhance completion accuracy.",Ashwini Gawali,agawali1,2024-02-02 19:46:22.000000,Neha Satish,nsatish6,2024-03-06 14:30:40.112046,"Hephzibah Abe Sam, Neha Satish, Vijay

1706903071,Contribution margin risk analysis tool,"In recent years, our company has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions, particularly related to IC electronic shortages. It has become increasingly clear that identifying, prioritizing, and proactively addressing these challenges through mitigation efforts is essential for ensuring operational stability and success.
Our objective was to develop a solution that would offer procurement teams enhanced visibility into the financial implications of supply chain disruptions, empowering more informed decision-making in addressing these challenges.
A key feature of our Contribution Margin Risk Analysis Tool is its capacity to assist procurement teams in identifying suppliers with the highest potential risk of causing production losses. By leveraging data-driven insights, we can prioritize mitigation efforts towards these suppliers and proactively manage associated risks.
The Contribution Margin Risk Analysis Tool (CM RAT) enables users to assess the risk posed by IC shortages on a vehicle line, utilizing contribution margin loss as an indicator to prioritize risk mitigation efforts.",false,2024-01-05,"",Ashwini Gawali,agawali1,2024-02-02 19:44:31.000000,Ashwini Gawali,agawali1,2024-02-02 19:51:36.361560,"Antriksh Mutha, Dmitry Snovalnikov, Patrick Lee","amutha, dsnovaln, plee10","","",File,"",1706903071/01-05-2024 Contribution margin risk analysis tool.pdf,1706903071/thumbnail_image/Contribution margin risk analysis tool.png,NA,Insights," CM RAT, Contribution margin risk analysis tool","",NA,Confidential
1706902666,Failure Prognostics Evaluation via  Expected Utility Theory,"Ford requires a comprehensive assessment of failure prognostics to determine priorities of prognostics projects and to establish criteria for determining when a failure prognostic (classifier) is good enough for deployment. Traditional measures of classifiers such as accuracy and f1 score, are inadequate for this purpose as they are not tied to business context. In this project, we propose a systematic, data-driven framework for evaluating the prognostic project accounting for business considerations. This framework can assess any trained classifier (physics-based, data-driven, or hybrid) and determine its readiness for deployment based on the Expected Utility Theory (EUT). The utility is derived from customer business contexts, primarily focusing on the cost of failure evaluation and the empirical failure rate. The EUT is further integrated into a systematic framework that can guide the development and deployment of a prognostic project throughout its lifecycle, from feasibility analysis to staged rollout.

However, the current method of generating heatmaps commonly requires the collection and storage of precise GPS data from vehicles, which introduces privacy risks. Here, we present a follow-up to our method of generating and visualizing heatmaps using differential privacy - a technology which provides robust mathematical guarantees on the privacy of data - and apply it to POC work replicating an ADAS use case. Further, we demonstrate our interactive heatmap visualization tool and present on-going work developing an API to allow for embedding differentially private heatmaps into custom dashboards.

1704730076,Stolen Vehicle Services Feature Inconsistent Vehicle Alert Triggering Too Often,"This ad hoc project had the goal of discovering if there was a specific software or hardware connected to the Inconsistent Vehicle Alert in the Stolen Vehicle Services project. A much larger number of alerts was uncovered in metrics discovery than should have been occurring. This alert is triggered based on GPS at Ignition On being more than a certain amount of miles different than it was at Ignition Off, so these false positive alerts could be connected to the other GPS studies that are being conducted. TCU and SYNC hardware and software were pulled to see if one attribute or a combination of them were greatly connected with this alert being triggered apart from the one legitimate trigger we are aware of happening. The amount of times this happened was analyzed, as well as normalized in a Rate per 1000 over Motive Mode Begins (since Ignition On is unavailable for non-fleet vehicles).",false,,"Because hardware appeared less involved than software, and the vehicle population enrolled in Stolen Vehicle Services were moving away from the more concerning software versions during summer 2023, the decision was to hold further analysis for now and pick it up when the feature is expanded into other vehicles and markets. In addition, SVS was transferred and the data tables stopped being loaded in anticipation of transferring to GCP in 2024, so an analysis of current state and whether the software versions being updated does indeed help reduce the false positive alert triggering will need to be taken up after that work is completed., MU5T-14G676-GA and MU5T-14G676-HB SYNC Strategy Part Numbers both have a high R/1000 for this alert. -GA was 3.35 R/1000 in July 2023 and -HB was 2.22., MU5T-14H085-GF TCU Strategy Part Number has a consistently higher R/1000 alerts over time, from a high of 9.08 in July 2022 to a low of 3.22 in July 2023., R/1000 of Inconsistent Vehicle Alerts has been dropping over time, from a high of 8.94 in July 2022 to 1.95 in July 2023.

The current study focuses on developing a physics-based model for modeling tire tread wear and its progression over time. The degradation of the unloaded tire radius is measured as the tire wear. The physics-based model is applied based on a patent submitted by Ford Motor Company to estimate the unloaded tire radius, considering the most important external factors such as tire pressure and loading.

1701705371,Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach for Predicting Brake Pad Wear,"	Brakes play a crucial role in the performance and safety of both internal combustion engines (ICEs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Monitoring brake degradation is essential for vehicle maintenance, but the traditional approach involving additional sensors can increase vehicle costs. To address this challenge, the development of a sensor-less approach for predicting brake pad wear using connected vehicle data has been proposed. 
	The study highlights the abundance of connected vehicle data and the need for efficient utilization to address the problem of brake wear monitoring. The authors emphasize the use of physics-informed machine learning to identify the underlying dynamics of brake wear characteristics in relation to vehicle operating conditions. 
	The study presents preliminary equations for estimating brake power and temperature generated at the brake pads using physics, providing a foundation for understanding the dynamics of brake wear. The authors acknowledge the complexity of identifying brake wear dynamics, which depends on brake pad power and temperature, and propose utilizing a physics-informed machine learning approach to learn these underlying dynamics. 
	The current status of the proposed approach is outlined, indicating the need for labeled data. The authors are collaborating with subject matter experts (SMEs) to obtain historical data and exploring options to acquire new data sets from actual vehicles or simulation models to validate the proposed strategy. References cited provide additional context and background on the utilization of physics-informed neural networks for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations and the connected vehicle prognostics framework for dynamic systems. (ref: M. Raissi, P. Perdikaris, and G.E. Karniadakis, Omar Makke and Oleg Gusikhin) 
	The study provides valuable insights into the potential of utilizing connected vehicle data and physics-informed machine learning to revolutionize brake maintenance by enabling predictive brake pad wear monitoring without the need for additional sensors.

1701705168,A Data-Driven Approach for Enhanced Prognostic Monitoring and Diagnostics of 12V Lead-Acid Batteries State of Health,"A new data-driven diagnostic and prognostic monitoring system has been developed for 12V Lead-Acid batteries' state-of-health (SoH). The system uses a Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm to continuously track changes in key internal battery states such as resistance and capacity. The Battery Monitoring Sensor (BMS) onboard provides the necessary signals for the algorithm to extract valuable insights into the battery's health status. The derived information serves two purposes: diagnostic information, addressing whether the battery requires replacement, and prognostic estimation, providing an estimate of the battery's future SoH. 
To enhance the prediction accuracy of the battery's SoH, the authors incorporate prior information about the mean and standard deviation of SoH into the RLS algorithm.
This innovation makes the algorithm more sensitive to a drop in SoH, serving as an early warning for battery health deterioration. The proposed methodology provides a software solution that leverages the Bosch BMS embedded in the vehicle, offering a cost-effective means of enhancing battery management. 
The potential benefits of this approach are substantial. It can mitigate the unnecessary replacement of functional batteries, leading to significant savings, particularly in cases of discharge-only scenarios. The system is not limited to dealerships and can also benefit individual consumers and fleet operators by providing crucial insights into the battery's SoH, enabling proactive planning for maintenance or service actions. Overall, the data-driven approach introduced in this paper offers economic and operational benefits across various sectors.

1699874004,Charging Location Reliability Rating,"The automotive industry is quickly heading towards a future with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), which requires periodic replenishment of battery charge from one of several types of charging systems. While Level 1 chargers are most used at home or for convenience trickle/top-off charging and some homes are getting Level 2; to get faster Level 2 and Level 3 charging one must go to a public charging location.  However, the ability to know a priori that a charger at either known or unknown locations is functioning properly, or the converse of inoperability is very important.  As many BEV drivers might deplete their state of charge to a point where they are effectively stranded from getting to their destination within the ability of charge, have an assurance of charging capability in certain geographical areas is important. For example, imagine your Mach-E has only 15 miles of range left, and you reach your charging station… but you find all the chargers are broken.
Based on this motivation, Ford needs to continue enhancing public charging experience to provide the freedom or peace of mind to our EV customers and enable them to take the trip they want to take, not the trip they have to take.  Therefore, Ford aims to build a comprehensive charging points assessment system that includes reliability, street view images, convenient and comfort rating. Our team from GDI&A Strategy & Enterprise Analytics department has developed a charging location reliability rating algorithm based on previous Ford EV customers' charging success and failure rates, which has been used to support several digital features/products in Model-e, such as Ford Rating, BCCA BUR, Charger Exclusive List, Charging Performance Analytics.  We will present the algorithm development process, analytics, use cases and future enhancement plan.",false,,"",Kai Wu,kwu41,2023-11-13 11:13:24.000000,Kai Wu,kwu41,2023-11-13 06:13:31.000000,"Alice Chen Zhang, Kai Wu","czhang99, kwu41","","",Grafana,Ad Hoc,1699874004/1-20-2023 -

1699282197,DTC Clustering: A Graph-based Approach to Discover DTCs Co-Occurrences,"DTC data collected through vehicle modems can indicate a potential failure before dealership visits and warranty claims. Early detection of quality issues leveraging DTCs can potentially shorten the detection-to-correction period of quality issues. Once QED detected a DTC with a spike or trend pattern, the root-cause investigation gets started by engineering team. However, resolving all issues at the same time is not feasible and the engineering/quality teams need a mechanism to prioritize the detected issues.

Clustering the DTC co-occurred with each other and indicate the same issue reduces the redundant Jira tickets and speed up the detection process significantly. In this work, we demonstrate an analytical approach to provide the DTC clustering and leverage it to improve Jira creation process.

1699281984,Fleet Vehicle GPS Outlier Detection,"Fleet customers often complain about bad GPS for their vehicles. Previous work looked at dealing with NULLs, zeroes, or points in the ocean. Without an estimation method we do not know the size of GPS errors, making it difficult to know how much of a problem this is and the major sources of these errors. In this project, we developed an algorithm to identify bad GPS and analysed the characteristics of those events with bad GPS to guide the search for the underlying problem. The algorithm identifies bad GPS by comparing the vehicle's speed calculated from GPS coordinatres with the speed obtained from the vehicle CAN BUS. If a large discrepancy is foudn between these two speeds, the GPS data is flagged. To further minimize false positives, we excluded scenarios that could potentially trigger them.

We sampled 3,314 VINs during the week of June 1-7, 2023 from the TCU4G fleet data. A total of 1.68 M GPS (excluding (0,0)) were examined. We compared the percentage of bad GPS data between FNV2 and pre-FNV2 vehicles, events (e.g. ignition on, periodic alert), fix type, SYNC type, SYNC version, GNSS source, and feature bundle.

Phase 2 Update: 36,595 VINs sampled from vehicles that send periodic alerts at 30 second intervals in the October 1-31, 2023 time frame. The same cleaning logic and segmentations were analyzed with this larger sample set, as well as bringing in different speed thresholds to compare sensitivity.
",false,2023-11-03,"A higher percentage of bad GPS comes from ignition off or older feature bundles for pre-FNV2 vehicles, but this was found to be due to some missing data between ignition on and ignition off, causing false positives., For FNV2 vehicles, an uncalibrated fix type combined with specific SYNC versions has a higher percentage of bad GPS.",Alex Tear,atear1,2023-11-06 14:46:24.000000,Alex Tear,atear1,2023-12-04 12:44:12.000000,"Alex Tear, Da Li, Richard Johnston, Toby Bischoff","atear1, dli118, rjohn829, tbischo7","","",Looker Studio,Ad Hoc,1699281984/gps outliers_factory_insights.pdf,1699281984/thumbnail_image/Fleet Vehicle GPS Outlier Detection.png,NA,"Insights, Study","FixType, Fleet, GPS",https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/bcb3a2f1-a944-4eca-b495-7386ee826186/page/p_dw7uy24l8c,"TCU4G Fleet Feature table, AIM DE VIN Dimension table, Vehicle Manufacturing (MFAL codes), GIVIS tables, otaconnectedvehicle table, strategy part number table",Secret
1699042886,Connected Vehicle DTC Prediction (PoC),"The CV quality group aims to enhance quality using CV data. Although current early detection systems monitor DTC spikes in warranty claims, which enables the team to assign resources and develop remediation strategies, roughly 60% of claims lack corresponding DTC tags. Imputing missing DTCs could help in estimating early detection effectiveness and developing mitigation strategies before issues escalate.  
 
In this project, we aimed to predict DTCs for warranty claims that do not have DTC labels through the similarity-based nearest neighbor clustering. We used the BERT model to generate embeddings for technician comments and DTC descriptions, and then calculated the similarity between embeddings and cluster centroids. The dataset comprised 1.75 M warranty claims from 1.1 M vehicles, with 3,646 unique DTCs in the labeled set.  
 
Despite our best efforts, we only achieved about 10% accuracy. This leads us to believe with the current data it is likely not possible to build an ML model to solve this problem. Therefore, this talk will delve into the challenges of this problem and suggest recommendations for future work. Specifically, we propose focusing on collecting the DTCs directly from the source instead of attempting to predict them later. By doing so, we can reap the benefits of DTC monitoring through reliable and near real-time DTC collection without incurring significant costs associated with model development and maintenance.

1698868869,F-150 PPO Usage During August Michigan Storm,"Over 760,000 watts consumed after Michigan August storm using Pro Power Onboard - industry leading power generation, on F-150s.On the evening of August 24, 2023, severe storms ripped through the southern part of Michigan causing widespread damage from Grand Rapids to Detroit. There were seven confirmed tornadoes and DTE Energy (Detroit-based energy company) reported over 200,000 people without power in the aftermath. As devastating as the storms were, Ford F-150 customers that have the Pro Power Onboard (PPO) feature were able to prolong their electricity supply. On August 25th, Ford's customers were able to consume over 760,000 watts during the power outages. For context, 760,000 watts is roughly 100 F-150 trucks consuming full capacity at 7200 watts.

We initially investigated four of many different charging related issues and created rules that could benefit fleet managers:
1.	Potential charging/charger issues  A historical search algorithm to detect potential charging abnormalities based on historical successful charging behavior. 2.	DC (Direct Current) charging past derate-identify DC charging events past 80 percent state of charge using FPI (Ford Pro Intelligence) charge logs and estimate the cost of those events. 3.	Unplanned Mid shift charging - Build a fleet profile and a vehicle profile and determine which is superior and flag for atypical Mid Shift charging.Public AC (alternating Current) charging occurrences - Flag public AC Charging costs from FPI (Ford Pro Intelligences) charge logs and identify fee reduction opportunities through alternative options. While building these indicators we also gained numerous of insights into unique fleet behaviors providing great customer understanding for our FPI partners.

1698858536,GLOBAL RELIABILITY DASHBOARD (GRDB): ANALYTICAL TOOL HELPING THE COMPANY IMPROVE LONG-TERM RELIABILITY OF ITS PRODUCTS,"In the light of the recent Quality initiatives, Ford's warranty performance at 3 months-in-service (MIS) has been steadily improving. However, in terms of high time-in-service (72-120 MIS), Ford is still behind some of its competitors, as evidenced by J.D.Power, Consumer Reports and Polk survival rates. While many long-term reliability problems can be detected and rectified at 3MIS, failures with an increasing failure rate (IFR) cannot and thus require special attention. Based on the methods of parametric survival analysis, GRBD is an analytical platform for identification and prioritization of high time-in-service warranty and reliability concerns. It embraces all regions, all vehicle lines, all part numbers (additionally stratified, for appropriate functional areas, by all engines and transmissions) for multiple consecutive Model Years. In addition to statistical reliability inferences, GRBD provides engineering inferences about field failure rates and factors affecting them. GRDB enjoys the Henry Ford Technology Award (HFTA-2019) and has close to 400 trained users worldwide.

1693942325,Cross OEM private compute,"Framing Question
How to protect customer and organizational data confidentiality and privacy while leveraging cross OEM data to improve EV experience? 
Background
EV charging infrastructure is foundational to our EV adoption and development. Publicly available charging infrastructure is supporting Ford EV as well as most EV OEMs, except Tesla. To build a reliable charging experience for customer, data about vehicle, charging stations and charging experience are important inputs to improve route recommendation and vehicle diagnostic. However, the current data coverage and density for each OEM is too sparse to use to conclude on charging experience at each charging station. Through sharing data cross OEMs and suppliers, we can build a better charging experience and infrastructure. However, sharing charging data with direct competitor comes with privacy concerns at both customer and organizational level. 
Problem Statement
This workstream focuses on addressing concerns related to information and raw data leak through such joint compute, aiming to develop platform level solutions that would enable data capabilities while protecting data/information from multiple OEMs in terms of data privacy (no information leak) and confidentiality (eyes-off).

K-Means clustering algorithm with K=3 identifies 3 distinct trip categories based on duration, speed, and distance: short and slow, medium, and long and fast trips. However, it resulted in most trips being grouped into a single dominant cluster.
Univariate percentile classification, dividing trip attributes into categories based on percentiles (25th -50th -75th -95th), better captures underlying trip behaviors by splitting trip attributes (speed, distance, and duration) into 5 intuitive bins.

1693942006,"A Comprehensive Survey of Local Differential Privacy, Brownbag Lecture 1","White paper review.

Wang, T., Zhang, X., Feng, J., and Yang, X., A Comprehensive Survey on Local Differential Privacy toward Data Statistics and Analysis, <i>Sensors</i>, vol. 20, no. 24, p. 7030, 2020. doi:10.3390/s20247030.

Collecting and analyzing massive data generated from smart devices have become increasingly pervasive in crowdsensing, which are the building blocks for data-driven decision-making. However, extensive statistics and analysis of such data will seriously threaten the privacy of participating users. Local differential privacy (LDP) has been proposed as an excellent and prevalent privacy model with distributed architecture, which can provide strong privacy guarantees for each user while collecting and analyzing data. LDP ensures that each user's data is locally perturbed first in the client-side and then sent to the server-side, thereby protecting data from privacy leaks on both the client-side and server-side. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of LDP with respect to privacy models, research tasks, enabling mechanisms, and various applications. Specifically, we first provide a theoretical summarization of LDP, including the LDP model, the variants of LDP, and the basic framework of LDP algorithms. Then, we investigate and compare the diverse LDP mechanisms for various data statistics and analysis tasks from the perspectives of frequency estimation, mean estimation, and machine learning. What's more, we also summarize practical LDP-based application scenarios. Finally, we outline several future research directions under LDP.

1693497548,OTA Desirability & Automatic Software Update (ASU) Trend Over Time,"This tool aids in analyzing Automatic Software Update (ASU) logs to gain insights into the customer impact of failures on deployments post FPU 4.1.2. ASU data became readily available starting with FPU 4.1.2. The objective is to understand the trend of ASU On vs OFF, impact of ASU OFF on inhibit updates and the breakdown of why updates have been cancelled (user cancellation vs other reasons). The ASU Dashboard displays in a monthly basis, a overall number of vehicles that are post 4.1.2 that has ASU status available and Recurring Scheduler as well (if they do have). Basically allows to understand in a trend how our costumer is willing with or without implied consent to receive an update and also comprehend what are their preferences such as weekdays and how many days per week when scheduling a OTA. You can also export that into vin table list and spot check any specific vehicle line and apply filters. There are also Additional Studies regarding ASU OFF impacting expired campaigns, OTA desirability and Cancelled Reasons.

What is ASU? 

ASU means Automatic Software Update, it is the ability to give consent automatically for the new Over The Air Updates.

- The TCU4G/ASU table contains information about a vehicle's Automatic Software Update (ASU) status. 
- ASU data became readily available starting with FPU 4.1.2
- Vehicles with ASU ON (implied consent) status receive OTA updates automatically without user notification, while those with ASU OFF (manual consent) status prompt the user for updates. 
- When a new software is ready to be installed the vehicle will prompt the user (ASU OFF), or to  automatically download the software at a scheduled time. 

Users have the option to set ASU to OFF, but still have a recurring schedule for an update. ",false,,"We Started with an investigation of all Cancellations
 We analyzed cloud cancellations further
We found that roughly 88% of these cancellations occurred within 30 seconds of deployment and should be considered deployment team cancellations
